# JuliaOceanSciencesMeeting2020

## Workshop description

_below is the original workshop proposal_

There has been a visible uptick in oceanography and climate applications of the Julia language since it reached the v1.0 milestone last year. The growth and appeal for this language were recently highlighted by Nature magazine. It seems very timely to offer this rapidly growing community of open source developers and users an opportunity to meet in person, advertise their recent efforts, and engage with the oceanographic community at large. A tentative agenda for this workshop would include: a brief general presentation of Julia, a survey of existing efforts, a hackathon-type session with both experienced and new users interacting, and open-ended discussion time.

## Workshop outline

_below is the current, still preliminary, workshop outline_

### intro (G.F. 15')

- workshop outline and motivation
- why should you want to use Julia?
- how can you get started with Julia?
- what are Julia's salient features?
- state of the ocean & climate stack?

### state of the Julia ocean stack (10 x 2' contributions)

If you would like to e.g. to advertise some of your julia packages or notebook folders at the workshop, point out an oversight, make suggestions, volunteer to help with the workshop -- please report to https://github.com/gaelforget/JuliaOceanSciencesMeeting2020/issues/1 

The list below is rather tentative & expected to evolve depending (e.g. on who is at OSM this week) but might include

- Plots.jl , PyPlot.jl, ClimatePlots.jl, GeoMakie.jl, ... (volunteer ?)
- NetCDF.jl, NCTiles.jl, zarr.jl, DataFrames.jl, ... (volunteer ?)
- MeshArrays.jl, IndividualDisplacements.jl, ArgoData.jl, ... (@gaelforget)
- AIBECS.jl, WorldOceanAtlasTools.jl, OceanographyCruises.jl, ... (@briochemc)
- NCDatasets.jl, DIVAnd.jl, PhysOcean.jl (@Alexander-Barth, to be confirmed)
- oceananigans.jl (@ali-ramadan or @glwagner ?)
- geophysicalflows.jl (@navidcy or @glwagner ?)
- ShallowWaters.jl (@milankl or proxy ?)
- ...

_Please forgive possible major oversight if any_

### open-ended discussion time (20')

Probably a moderated Q & A ; the idea of a hackathon is also possible but might be impractical

### looking forward (G.F. 5')

- this repo; during & after OSM020
- github organizations & contributors
- JuliaClimate and JuliaOcean organizations
